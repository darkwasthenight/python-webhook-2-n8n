# python-webhook-2-n8n

Webhook URL:
Update the $n8nWebhookUrl variable with the actual URL of your n8n webhook (as configured in your n8n workflow).

Payload Preparation:
The $payload array holds the data that will be sent to n8n. Adjust this array to match the structure expected by your n8n workflow (for example, details about an order, user events, etc.).

JSON Encoding:
The payload is encoded into JSON format using json_encode(), which is required for many webhook integrations.

cURL Setup:
A new cURL session is initiated, and options are set to send a POST request with the JSON payload. The HTTP header is set to Content-Type: application/json to inform the receiver about the data format.

Execution and Error Handling:
The request is executed using curl_exec(). If any error occurs during the process, it will be printed. Otherwise, the response from the n8n webhook is displayed.

Closing the Session:
Finally, the cURL session is closed with curl_close().
